# BlinkTalk
Written for a friend with locked-in syndrome.

Run the app, point it at the person you wish to communicate with, and whenever they blink you click the side of the screen with the large button.

The person blinking can select letters and words to speak out loud. The app uses a few tricks to determine what the user is most likely to say next based on a history of previously used words + word combinations.

## Build
Open in Unity3D and run it.
